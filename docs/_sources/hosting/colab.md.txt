As [Jina is fully compatible to Google Colab](https://docs.jina.ai/how-to/google-colab/), CLIP-as-service can be run smoothly on Colab as well. One can host `clip_server` on Google Colab by leveraging its free GPU/TPU resources and open up to 4 replicas of `ViT-L/14-336px`. Then you can send request from local to the server for embedding, ranking and reasoning tasks. 

Specifically, the architecture is illustrated below:

Please follow the walk-through there. Enjoy the free GPU/TPU to build your awesome Jina applications!


```{tip}
Hosing service on Google Colab is not recommended if you server aims to be long-live or permanent. It is often used for quick experiment, demonstration or leveraging its free GPU/TPU. For stable, please deploy the CLIP model on your own server.
